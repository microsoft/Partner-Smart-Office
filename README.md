**Security is a primary concern for Microsoft, and its partners and customers.**

Office 365 customers are provided with many tools to help improve their security practices, however many do not take advantage of these tools. To assist their customers, Microsoft partners looking to manage security threats need a way to streamline and aggregate security information across their entire customer base. To facilitate partners aggregating this information for customers either with subscriptions obtained through an Enterprise Agreement or the Cloud Solution Provider program, an opensource solution called Partner Smart Office has been introduced.

Partner Smart Office imports and aggregates information obtained using the Intelligent Security Graph and Office 365 Secure Score, enabling partners to take advantage of advanced analytics. These analytics can link threat intelligence and security data to provide insights that can strengthen a customer’s organization security. Partners can now also view security data across all customers at once.  

Secure Score is a numerical summary of a given customer’s security posture within Office 365 based on system configurations, user behavior, and other security-related measurements. It represents the extent to which the customer has adopted security controls available in Office 365, which can help offset the risk of being breached. No online service is completely immune from security breaches; Secure Score should not be interpreted as a guarantee against security breach in any manner.

If you are interested in gaining additional security insights for your customers, that allow you to craft targeted offers the we would like to encourage you to deploy Partner Smart Office.
